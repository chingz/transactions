# fullstack-js-interview

PPRO's coding exercise for new JS developers.

This exercise merges the old coding exercise and the Unix exercise into a single exercise.

## Preparations

Please make sure that the candidate has internet access. If necessary, ask Helpdesk or the
reception for the Guest Wifi password. Then ask the candidate to read the INSTRUCTIONS.md file.
It's in our public repository:

	https://gitlab.com/ppro/fullstack-js-interview

## Solutions

The master branch only contains the exercise. We moved the solutions to a separate branch
called `solutions`. It's only available on our PPRO gitlab repo, not on gitlab.com.

## Changes

If you want to change the sources then proceed as usual (create a feature branch and a merge
request), but only in PPRO's gitlab repository. The master branch is then automatically
mirrored to gitlab.com.
